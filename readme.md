# ArduinoISP
This is a sketch that allows your Arduino to work as a STK500v1 programmer.

## Use a recent version!
The ArduinoISP that ships as an example with the Arduino software is old.
You can download the ArduinoISP.pde here and replace the one you find
in ...\arduino-002x\examples\ArduinoISP.

This version is known to work with the avrdude that ships with Arduino-0023.
That is an older version of avrdude (5.04, latest is 5.11).
